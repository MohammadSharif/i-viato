This README will contain the necessary links to navigate through our
repository according to each major component to the application and pipeline.

* [Application Front End](https://github.com/MohammadSharif/i-viato/tree/develop/iviato-ui)
The application front end is implemented using HTML, CSS, and [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react).
React makes it easy to reuse stateful components and allows for efficient rendering. We also made use of the
[Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) component library to help stylize our UI.  

* [Application Back End](https://github.com/MohammadSharif/i-viato/tree/develop/iviato-api)
The back end for the application is written using NodeJS.

* [Application Pipeline Code](https://github.com/MohammadSharif/i-viato/tree/develop/iviato-pipeline)
The pipeline of the application is written using C and Python. We've also made use of Tristan Hume's
[eyeLike](https://github.com/trishume/eyeLike) for pupil tracking, [dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib),
[OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)
